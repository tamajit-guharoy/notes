ec2 machines loses its root volume when it is manually termitted.
Sometimes you need a way to store your instance data somewhere.
An EBS volume is a network drive you can attach to your instance  while they run,where you can persist data
EBS volume is a network drive(not a physical drive)
So EBS volume can be easily detached from one EC2 and attached to another EC2 very quickly
Its locked to an Availability Zone(AZ)
To move a volume content across AZ we need to create snapshot
EBS volume is characterized by  size in Gb , IPOS and throughput.And we will be billed not for the used capacity but for the provisioned capacity.These capacity can be changed any time we want.
An ec2 instance can be attached to multiple EBS volume.



df -h  #shows all volumes mount info

newly attached disks and their partitions:
lsblk


mkfs -t {xfs|ext4} /dev/xvdf


check filesystem of a disk
file -s /dev/xvdf


mounting:
mkdir -p /apps/mypath
mount /dev/xvdf /apps/mypath
df -h



EBS volume types:
1)GP2(SSD)=>
balance price and performance(Most common)
1GB - 16 TB
Has the concept of IPOS burst,IOPS can burst upto 10times the base performance,max 10000 IPOS.
Max thoughput 160 MB/s


2)IO1(high performance SSD)=>
for mission critical low latency and high throughput requirement
more IOPS and throughput than GP2
Good option for high performance database
4GB - 16 TB
Max iops 32000
Max throughput 500 MB/s

3)ST1(HDD)=>
low cost
cannot be a boot volume(use any SSD variant for boot volume)
Good for data wharehousing,log processing
500GB - 16 TB
max IPOS 500
Not good for random read/write but good for sequential read/write. eg batch processing
max throughput 500 MB/s(can burst)
 

4)SC1(HDD)=>lowest cost
500Gb- 16Tb size
max IPOS 250
max throughput 250 MB/s(can burst)
